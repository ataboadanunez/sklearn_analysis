# sklearn_analysis
Code used to perform Linear Discriminant Analysis and Principal Component Analysis with Scikit-learn.\
This code was used to produce some of the results of my [PhD thesis](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000104548) which consisted in the analysis of data from measurements of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
